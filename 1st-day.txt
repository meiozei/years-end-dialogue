Intro
It is the month of December in the year of 2020, with the snow falling outside your window… you are reminded of the days you dwelled in your room, holed up as the year ends with it being all the same.

Quarantine never ended for you.

And it almost seems like as if everything as growing darker

You need to save yourself before you lose grasp of reality.


AREA: Your room

Mom knocks on your door, waking you up
Jin, wake up! Dinner is ready.. You’ve been up there holed all day!

DIALOGUE OPTIONS: 
> Yeah yeah, I’ll get up..
> Later.
> I’ll be there in a bit!

[3rd option, I’ll be there in a bit]

Okay.. but don’t take too long okay sweetheart? Your father’s a bit..

Jin: again..?

Don’t mind it, you already know what you have to do right? 

Jin: yeah.. I know.. 

Hanna comes by and stays still beside him

Hanna: maybe we could eat inside his room first, is that okay mom? 

Ah.. sure..but your father-- 

Hanna: It’ll be fine, as long as we don’t disturb his session right? 

Jin: ….

Hanna: Are you okay?
